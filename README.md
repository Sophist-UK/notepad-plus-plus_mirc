Notepad++ language files for mIRC scripting

This GitHub repo os to store the languiage xml file and test.mrc file for Notepad++ language definitions for the mIRC scripting language.

In order to try to make this as comprehensive as possible, this language definition has been developed from the detailed mIRC help file, however the help file may not be perfect and the translation to notepad++ language definitions may be imporfect too.

The mIRC scripting language also has several esoteric features (using / // or . in front of commands, putting # in frontg of $identifiers or and changing $ to $! in identifiers) which are difficult to test, and which in some cases conflict with other uses of the same string. So it is quite likely that these definitions are not completely perfect for these reasons too. 

So if you find something not quite right, please submit a GitHub issue giving a code example and your mIRC version, or even better submit a GitHub Pull Request with proposed changes.

I hope you enjoy using this.

To install, download https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sophist-UK/notepad-plus-plus_mirc/master/mIRC.xml to a temporary directory and use the Import button on the notepad++ "Language / Define your language..." pop-up screen.

If you open https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sophist-UK/notepad-plus-plus_mirc/master/mIRC-test.mrc into notepad++ you can see what it looks like in use.

The current version is 1.00 based on mIRC 7.48.
